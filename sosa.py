jolly_text = '''David. I want you to take a second and examine the context of the message you just sent. First consider you: In this online server you decided to share your opinions towards a childrenâ€™s mobile game in an extremely obnoxious and abrasive manner, while also sacrificing your own public image and command of respect. Wallowing in self-pity from your own supposed misfortune, you decided to take to the internet and unleash your childish frustration with the fury of a toddler whose parents will not buy him a toy. Now consider everyone else: We were all having a pleasant, enjoyable day. Nobody ever asked you to share your opinions nor does anyone care. Yet in despite of this, we were directed towards a notification on our phones, where our own curiosity led to a disappointing and rather irritating shitpost made by our self-centered clanmate. Finally consider your actions in relationship to the game itself: Most likely you are pissing up a storm from ladder matchups or whatever. However, according to the official clash royale app store description, clash royale is a real time STRATEGY game. This in itself implies that SKILL is a deciding factor in winning games. WIth this in mind it is logical to assume that a player of your caliber did not have the SKILL nor STRATEGY to win your games. David, please, next time before you take to the internet to cry over your self-induced video game depression and bother your fellow clanmates with your infantile wailing, do some introspection and just OUTPLAY.
